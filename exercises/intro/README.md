# Intro

Welcome to ZKLings. This is a series of exercises to help you learn the fundamentals of Zero Knowledge. The exercises are designed to be fun and challenging. They are also designed to be done in order. Each exercise builds on the previous one, but feel free to going back and forth as needed.

## What is a Zero Knowledge Proof?

As the name says, it is a proof that you have some valid information without the need to reveal this information. In a more formal way zero knowledge proof or zero knowledge protocol are a class of cryptographic protocols that allow one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true, without conveying any information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true.
