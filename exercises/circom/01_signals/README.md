# Simple Addition

This is a simple example of a circuit that adds two numbers and outputs the result.

## Signals

In circom we can define three types of signals: `input`, `output` or intermediate (if we don't specify any of the previous ones).

We can think of input signals as the values that the prover will provide to the circuit (private or public), the output as the public value generated by the computation, and the intermediate values as the values in between the computation trace which should all be private.

Signals can be assigned with the following operators:

- `<--` and `-->` corresponding to an assignment in the witness generation code produced by the compiler.
- `<==` and `==>` which adds a constraint to the R1CS system stating that the signal is equal to the assigned expression.

If we assign signals with the single arrows, we should be careful to add constraints that will check the validity of the computation. Otherwise, a malicious prover can define arbitrary values for the unconstrained signals.
